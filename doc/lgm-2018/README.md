* Status: Proposed

## Title
Plotting openly 

## Proposal
Before the ubiquity of inkjet printers and mobile devices, the pen-plotter was a common way to physically realize and share a digital drawing. Today the plotter remains one of the simplest example of a computer-controlled fabrication device, perfect for learning the basics of digital fabrication.

Join us to learn how these machines work, how to control it using open software and make them output your drawings!

We will provide some plotters based on the TapeCore open hardware project. The machines are designed to be easily replicated in a local makerspace/fablab, so that you can build your own.

Participants should bring their laptops.

## Presenter bio
Jon is an engineer who loves working on projects which combine software, electronics and mechanics.
Since 2016 he is active in the maker community in Oslo, researching how make digital fabrication
accessible by designing open-hardware machines that require a minimum amount of specialized parts and skills.

Jon has previously participated in the libre graphics community as a MyPaint and GEGL/GIMP developer.
At day he runs an Internet-of-Things consultancy named Flowhub.


## TODO

Machine

* See ./README.md

Workshop

* Decide format/structure
* What software should participants use/learn?

Maybe

* Test laser-engraver head
* Test dragknife head

## Goal
Finish first version of simple plotter/engraver.
Documentation enough to replicate locally.
Inspire others to replicate it in their local lab.
