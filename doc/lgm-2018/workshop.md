## TapeCore

- LOW cost
- LOW tech
- OK performance

Fabricatable in makerspace/fablab 

- Few speciality tools
Lasercut + 3d-printed.
- Few speciality parts.
Instead: Digital fabricated and generic consumables.
Tape (Kapton/UHWMPE), Wire/fishing line.

BAD: glue, screws

Why penplotters

## Fabricatable machines

https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines

- Medium to high-end machines
- CNCed Aluminum/POM
- Chamfer rail
- Humprey: Full-size CNC
- FAB2.0 - build a Fablab in a Fablab



## Digital fabrication

### Concept

- Digital 3d-model
- Digitall controlled machine

In practice: Lots of manual labor, craft involved

### Where is this taking us?

- Less human labor, manual skills needed
- Mass-production
- Mass-customization
Each part can be unique 

### Democratization

Ensure the benefits are widely distributed instead of going to a selected few.

* Shared public access. Maker/hackerspaces + Fablabs
* Open online manufacturing services.
Ponoko,3d-hubs,Shapeways,iMaterialize
* Open source hardware.
Reprap project, Prusa i3
* Open source software.
 Grbl, Marlin
* Consumer market.
Low prices, OK volume,
Makers as early adopters

### Process

Generally

    CAD -> CAM -> MC

    CAD: Computer-Aided Design
    CAM: Computer-aided Manufacturing
    MC: Machine Control


Example Plotting:

    Inkscape -> Inkscape gcodetools -> OctoPrint 

Example LaserCutting:



Why these divisions?

- Legacy: In instrustry often separate personell for each role
- CAD: Best software depends on what to design.
- CAM/MC: Depends on technology



Open loop. Dead reckoning
